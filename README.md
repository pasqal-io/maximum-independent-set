# Maximum independent set


The **Maximum Independent Set (MIS)** library provides a flexible, powerful, and user-friendly Python interface for solving [Maximum Independent Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_set_(graph_theory)) problem using Quantum technologies. It is designed for **scientists and engineers** working on optimization problemsâ€”**no quantum computing knowledge required** and **no quantum computer needed** for testing.

This library lets users treat the solver as a **black box**: feed in a graph, get back an optimal (or near-optimal) independent set. For more advanced users, it offers tools to **fine-tune algorithmic strategies**, leverage **quantum hardware** via the Pasqal cloud, or even **experiment with custom quantum sequences** and processing pipelines.

Users setting their first steps into quantum computing will learn how to implement the core algorithm in a few simple steps and run it using the Pasqal Neutral Atom QPU. More experienced users will find this library to provide the right environment to explore new ideas - both in terms of methodologies and data domain - while always interacting with a simple and intuitive QPU interface.

## Installation

### Using `hatch`, `uv` or any pyproject-compatible Python manager

Edit file `pyproject.toml` to add the line

```
  "maximum-independent-set"
```

to the list of `dependencies`.

### Using `pip` or `pipx`
To install the `pipy` package using `pip` or `pipx`

1. Create a `venv` if that's not done yet

```sh
$ python -m venv venv

```

2. Enter the venv

```sh
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the package

```sh
$ pip install maximum-independent-set
# or
$ pipx install maximum-independent-set
```

## QuickStart

```python
from mis import MISSolver, MISInstance
import networkx as nx

# Generate a simple graph (triangle)
graph = nx.Graph()
graph.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (0, 2)])

# Create an instance for the solver
instance = MISInstance(graph)

# Solve the MIS problem
results = MISSolver.solve(instance)

print("MIS solution:", results.solution)
print("Solution cost:", results.cost)
```
