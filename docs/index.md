# Maximum independent set

The **Maximum Independent Set (MIS)** library provides a flexible, powerful, and user-friendly Python interface for solving [Maximum Independent Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_set_(graph_theory)) problem using Quantum technologies. It is designed for **scientists and engineers** working on optimization problemsâ€”**no quantum computing knowledge required** and **no quantum computer needed** for testing.

This library lets users treat the solver as a **black box**: feed in a graph, get back an optimal (or near-optimal) independent set. For more advanced users, it offers tools to **fine-tune algorithmic strategies**, leverage **quantum hardware** via the Pasqal cloud, or even **experiment with custom quantum sequences** and processing pipelines.

Users setting their first steps into quantum computing will learn how to implement the core algorithm in a few simple steps and run it using the Pasqal Neutral Atom QPU. More experienced users will find this library to provide the right environment to explore new ideas - both in terms of methodologies and data domain - while always interacting with a simple and intuitive QPU interface.
